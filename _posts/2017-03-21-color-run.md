# Paint the Playground Color Run

Saturday, April 15\\
8:00 - 10:00 AM\\
Burnley-Moran Elementary School\\
[Puchase Tickets](https://painttheplayground.eventbrite.com)

The Burnley-Moran PTO invites local Charlottesville runners, walkers, and families to participate in our first annual color run, Paint the Playground presented by Whole Foods & Tom Tom Founders Festival. This family-friendly, 1 mile race, will be held Saturday, April 15th at 8:00 am at Burnley-Moran Elementary School.
The race will feature color powder stations throughout the accessible 1-mile loop. Your complimentary white race shirt will be a masterpiece by the time you cross the finish line! We will celebrate with a dance party, refreshments, and raffle.

All proceeds from the race will go towards improving the outdoor play space at Burnley-Moran Elementary. While this will be a huge benefit to our students, it will impact the larger downtown community as a whole, since our playground is open to the public in the evenings and on weekends.

This event is sure to be an experience to remember for the whole family! We can't wait to see you there!
