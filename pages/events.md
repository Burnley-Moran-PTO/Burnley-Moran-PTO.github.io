## Restaurant days

Restaurant Days offer families a chance to have a day off from cooking while also earning money for the school.  Burnley-Moran receives a portion of the proceeds from the restaurant’s sales brought in by BME families on the designated days.

All we need is your participation... the more BME families patronize these restaurants on the designated days, the more Burnley-Moran will benefit.  Use the schedule below to mark your calendars for the 2016 – 2017 school year and let us help make your mealtime easier! 

## Fabio’s Pizza
