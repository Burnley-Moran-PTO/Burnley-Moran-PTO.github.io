title: Ways to Give
permalink: /give/
intro: There are many ways to give to the PTO, whether it be your time, expertise, or money. Any of these will have a huge impact on our school and our children's education.

The PTO runs several fundraisers throughout the year. We have handpicked programs we feel will be the most successful for the school. If you don't like to participate in fundraisers, you can also donate directly to the Burnley-Moran PTO.

## Volunteer
There are many ways you can volunteer at Burnley-Moran, from PTO events and programs to general school-wide opportunities. The PTO has a spot for everyone-even if you only have an hour to give! We need volunteers at events, behind the scenes workers and committee chairs. We need cookies baked, events attended and money raised. We hope you will join us! Volunteer opportunities often arise throughout the year and will be posted on this website, our facebook page, and in the monthly newsletter.

## Make a donation
The Burnley-Moran PTO budget will be directed toward supporting the cultural arts, technology needs, and field trips, along with essential classroom supplies and many other needs at BME.

New in 2017, we have also created a Bobcat Community Assistance Fund for Burnley-Moran families in crisis.  Each year, the PTO receives multiple requests for assistance from families at our school who are in crisis. We can make meaningful impacts in the lives of families in our own Burnley-Moran family

We welcome you to make a contribution to the Burnely-Moran Elementray PTO Fund anytime throughout the school year.  Please contact us if you would prefer to write a check.
