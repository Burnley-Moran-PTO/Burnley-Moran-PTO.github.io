<p class="usa-font-lead">The Burnley-Moran Parent Teacher Organization is a non-profit aimed at fostering a vibrant school community and supporting quality education for all Burnley-Moran students.</p>

## Free Community Events
We hold fun events to allow students and families to get to know each other and create a sense of community.  Events include summer popsicle parties on our playground, football tailgate at CHS, roller skating & ice skating at Carver Rec, and more!

## Fundraising Event
Our signature fundraising event for the year is the Walk-a-Thon. The money raised at this event, funds our free community events and enrichment efforts for the entire year.

## Teacher Appreciation
We provides meals, snacks, and appreciation events for Burnley-Moran faculty and staff on select teacher workdays and special occasions. Volunteers assist with planning and executing teacher appreciation luncheons and small surprises throughout the year.

## Enrichment
We provide funding for enrichment activities on a classroom, grade level, and school-wide basis. This includes classroom supplies, field trips, and school-wide improvements. We also fund 8-week after-school enrichment clubs in the Winter.

## Community Assistance
The PTO support Bobcat families in times of need with our Bobcat Community Assistance Fund.
 
## Bobcat T-Shirts
Students and parent can show their Bobcat pride by purchasing a Burnley-Moran shirt for $10. Shirts are on sale at most school events or contact us to purchase.  All proceeds go directly to the Burnley-Moran PTO.

## School Directory
Contact information for Burnley-Moran families is collected for a printed directory.  Participation is optional.
