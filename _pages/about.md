description: The Burnley-Moran Parent Teacher Organization is a non-profit aimed at fostering a vibrant school community and supporting quality education for all Burnley-Moran students.

The funds raised by the PTO go directly back into the school to impact all BME students. The PTO pays for field trips, playground equipment, school landscaping improvements, teacher appreciation events, and many other events, activities, and supplements.  PTO-sponsored activities and events not only raise much-needed funds but are also a great way to become a part of the Bobcat family!

We welcome all parents of Burnley-Moran students to participate in the PTO. Our meetings take place on the third Thursday of the month and free childcare is provided.

## Monthly Newsletter

We send home a monthly newsletter in the studentâ€™s backpacks. If you prefer a digital copy via email please [contact us]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _pages/contact.html %})!
