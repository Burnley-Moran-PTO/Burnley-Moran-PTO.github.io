tagline: Welcome Bobcat families!
intro: >-
  The funds raised by the PTO go directly back into the school to impact all BME
  students. The PTO pays for field trips, playground equipment, teacher
  appreciation events, and many other events, activities, and supplements.
  PTO-sponsored activities and events not only raise much-needed funds but are
  also a great way to become a part of the Bobcat family!


  _We welcome all parents of Burnley-Moran students to participate in the PTO.
  Our meetings are held every other month from 5:30-6:30pm in the library. This
  year meetings will be held: Sep 25, Nov 13, Jan 15, Mar 19, and May 14. Join
  us! _
