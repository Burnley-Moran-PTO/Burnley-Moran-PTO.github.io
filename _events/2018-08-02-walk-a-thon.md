Our major school fundraiser! Students receive pledges from friends & family for every lap they run during Walk-a-thon. The students start training with their classes in September. It is a wonderful BME tradition that encourages health and fitness while raising money for our school. The money raised funds all of the PTO initiatives for the school year.

More details will come home in your student's backpack.
