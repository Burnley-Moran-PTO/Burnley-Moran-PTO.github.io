Join us at Chipotle in Pantops between 5-9pm to raise money for our Bobcat Community Assistance fund. We will receive a third of all proceeds for the evening which we will use to help BME families in crisis. If you are unable to attend, consider [making a donation to the fund](https://squareup.com/store/burnleymoranpto). We can make meaningful impacts in the lives of families in our own Burnley-Moran community.
