    <h1>Ways to Give</h1>
  </header>
  <p class="usa-font-lead">There are many ways to give to the PTO, whether it be your time, expertise, or money. Any of these will have a huge impact on our school and our children's education.</p>
  
  <p>The PTO runs several fundraisers throughout the year. We have handpicked programs we feel will be the most successful for the school. If you don’t like to participate in fundraisers, you can also donate (anchor to donate blurb) directly to the Burnley-Moran PTO.</p>

<h2 id="volunteer">Volunteer</h2>
<p>There are many ways you can volunteer at Burnley-Moran, from PTO events and programs to general school-wide opportunities. The PTO has a spot for everyone-even if you only have an hour to give! We need volunteers at events, behind the scenes workers and committee chairs. We need cookies baked, events attended and money raised. We hope you will join us! Volunteer opportunities often arise throughout the year and will be posted on this website, our facebook page, and in the monthly newsletter.</p>

<h2 id="make-a-donation">Make a donation</h2>
<p>The Burnley-Moran PTO budget will be directed toward supporting the cultural arts, technology needs, and field trips, along with essential classroom supplies and many other needs at BME.</p>

<p>We welcome you to make a contribution to the Burnely-Moran Elementray PTO Fund anytime throughout the school year.  Please contact us if you would prefer to write a check.</p>

<h3 id="link---shop---earn">Link - Shop - Earn!</h3>
